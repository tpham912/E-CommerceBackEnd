# Description 

E-commerce is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to their prevalence, the purpose of this homework is to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. We utilize a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.
